# 🧠 Stroke Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a **machine learning classification model** that predicts the risk of stroke in patients based on various health-related and demographic features. Early detection of stroke risk can play a crucial role in preventive healthcare and patient monitoring.

## 📊 Dataset Description

### 🔍 Source
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

- **Dataset Name:** Stroke Prediction Dataset  
- **Total Records:** 5,110  
- **Total Features:** 12 (including the target variable)

### 🧾 Problem Statement
Build a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of a stroke using the given health-related features. This model can be used by healthcare professionals for early intervention and treatment.
